# Zile Beni (Legacy)
Zile Beni is a legacy project created by the former members of the extinguished Hiscom Studios. This was created while we were game design students of Universidade Anhembi Morumbi as part of our final evalutation.

<h2> Goals </h2>
<p>
  In order to do this game, we were proposed to create a brand new different thing from usual; it should be a problem-solver, not mattering if the problem was an actual problem, a feature problem, or whatever it was. It should deonstrate all of our skills; be the group's masterpiece.
</p>

<h2> Achieved </h2>
<p>
  We decided to create a 2.5d very cartoonized videogame were the player controled <b>Niara</b>, a girl who lost her parents during the invasion of a god in her island, and should now fight him in order to save everyone else. The ¨problem¨ that we decided to solve was to create a game in which the main feature was NPCs death as a punishement by letting the player decide who should die if he lost a battle against the God. The thing is that every character could give the player additional boosts, such as health, strenght or stamina.
